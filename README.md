# mysql2-query-builder

Simple abstraction for create composable sql queries base on `mysql2`.

This is a repo for teaching my junior students and I recommend to use more powerful solution like a ORM. However you can use it this will be ready for production, more for those project that use direct string sql commands in the persistance layer.
